## Software Architect | Senior Developer | Building modern apps with great tools | Open-source contributor

### Hi there 👋
- My developer journey began in 2005 when I built a small personal website in PHP that quickly grew into a full portal with chat, forums, leaderboards, and custom features. I enjoyed building things in PHP for a few years, and that early experiment pulled me into the web world and ultimately shaped my entire career. 

- Since 2013 I have been focused on .NET and making Web applications.
- I now have over 12 years of professional experience building modern, high-quality applications, primarily within the .NET ecosystem. I’m especially passionate about ASP\.NET Core and Blazor, and I enjoy turning ideas into complete end-to-end solutions that deliver real value for clients, teams, and my own projects 🗲

- My specialty lies in developing MVPs and web applications from scratch, utilizing my expertise in .NET to deliver top-notch products. What drives me the most is the satisfaction of creating applications that benefit and bring value to my clients, whether the client is someone else or myself or my family. 😃

### 🔭 &nbsp;Currently

- Enjoying building various .NET applications (mostly web), and a Rust-powered Wayscriber annotation tool, being focused on Arch + Hyprland, working in VS Code or Rider with Copilot and Codex at my side.
